# Online-Shop-Apache-Thrift
The project is an example of Apache Thrift Framework -> http://thrift.apache.org/
The client and handlers implementation is based on a thrift file that contains the interface definition. 
On the server side - there are two TCP sockets. Each of them provides a single service for a shop logic.
